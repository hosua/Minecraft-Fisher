# Minecraft-Fisher
A Minecraft fishing bot, inspired from https://github.com/FairfieldTekLLC/McFishing

Originally, this was written in C#. However, I wanted to rewrite it in Python for fun, and so that I could get it working on Linux.

Note: You will have to bind your right-mouse-button to 'R' ingame. I had to use a keybind instead of the mouse as a workaround due to some weird issues on Linux.

Start the bot by pressing the ~ key (right under esc) and press F1 to stop. 

For best results, turn your brightness all the way up and make sure the area you are in is very lit. The program works by detecting a specific shade of red on the bobber. If this fails for any reason such as poor lighting, or another red entity being detected, the bot will not work properly.
